<h1>Participate</h1>

<p>Databib is currently being developed and improved. Your input and participation are welcomed! Please <a href="http://databib.lib.purdue.edu/register.php">create an account</a> and begin using the site.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with a data repository that isn't on Databib yet? <a href="mailto:databib@gmail.com">Email us</a> its URL for us to add a record for it, or better yet, <a href="http://databib.lib.purdue.edu/submit.php">submit a record</a> yourself. A rubric with guidelines for identifying and describing data repositories for Databib is in draft form <a href="http://databib.lib.purdue.edu/Databib_Rubric_Draft.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Can you enhance or correct existing Databib records? Click the &quot;Edit&quot; link underneath each record to suggest changes.</p>
<p>You can also add an annotation to append information or comments that are not acommodated within the metadata of the record.</p>
<p>All submitted records, edits, and annotations will be queued for review by an editor and become available after they have been approved.</p>
<p>If you are interested in serving in the future as an editor for Databib, please contact <a href="mailto:mwitt@purdue.edu">Michael Witt</a>, Project Director.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think?</strong></p>
<p>Are there other features you'd like to see with Databib? Are there other useful connections that we could be making through controlled vocabularies or new collaborations? Is this tool useful to you?</p>

<p>We would appreciate your suggestions and feedback! Please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:databib@gmail.com">databib@gmail.com</a>.</p>
